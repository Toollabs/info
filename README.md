I created that organization because I want to
- provide a larger number of people access to my tool's code and 
- to facilitate collaborative editing on tools.
The repo name should match or close to be the tool's name. I didn't know about https://github.com/tool-labs but it seems to be kinda one-man organization with all members hidden.
