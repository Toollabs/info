# Toollabs
[toolinfo.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Toollabs/info/master/toolinfo.json): [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Toollabs/info.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Toollabs/info)

## What's this organization for?

Toollabs
- provides a larger number of people access to tool's code and 
- facilitates collaborative editing on tools.

## Why Toollabs on GitHub?
You know you can host your code with [Wikimedia Gerrit](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/New_repositories), too? Okay, we choose GitHub because:
- it usually provides faster access
- it is not hosted inside the same data center, together with the tool labs instances
- allows everyone (owners, administrators) to deal with accesss rights and to set up hooks/ CI/ Travis
- has a nice and fast web interface, a properly working search button and some native clients that work out-of-the-box (SourceTree and GitHub for Windows)

## How should repos be named?
The repo name should match or close to be the tool's name.

## Adding new members
You are free to add everyone you trust to the groups you can add them to. If you are not 100% sure, create a new **administrator** group and invite them to this group. They will then be able to transfer their repos to Toollabs.

## Should I push directly to someone's master branch?
If you don't know them (or you know that they'll feel offended), better don't do this. Either create an own fork and a pull request from that fork or create a new feature-branch and a pull request from this branch.
